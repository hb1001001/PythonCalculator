# PythonCalculator
# This project was a test from a technical interview I failed to complete. The challenge was to create a calculator without using the X or % (times or divide) symbols, only using + and -. I wasn't able to complete the test then , but I completed it in my own time as I wanted to know how to solve the problem. This is my solution.
